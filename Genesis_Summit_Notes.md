# Genesis Summit Notes

## Snapshot
- Civilizational hinge: market and state legitimacy is weakening; the commons must re-center.
- Historical pulsation: in crises, commons seed forms reorganize society (monasteries and guilds then; cosmo-local nodes now).
- Technology alone is not salvation: property and productive capacity in place matter most.
- Culture and class are split: digital money vs. local production and identity; narrative plus material wins must bridge them.
- Coordination beyond nation-states is needed without one big regulator: start with open standards and mutual recognition among nodes.
- Ronald Jean Toussaint adds a culture lens: media replaced transmission by family and tradition; fixation on external enemies; loss of resonance and relation to nature.
- Day 2 takeaways: a positive frame called Hyperhumanism can host dimension-enhancing technologies inside a commons and regenerative economy.
- Strategy theme: build an archipelago of regenerative projects and replicate when a node is strong.

## Day 1 - Michel Bauwens - Key Points
- Pulsation of the commons: when market and state thrive, commons contract; in breakdown periods, commons can become hegemonic.
- History: after the fall of Rome, monastic orders and guilds spread and helped heal land and production; recurring dark ages reset institutions.
- Narrative and measurement co-produce institutions.
- Modern seeds: 1993 web opening; 2008 Bitcoin as a socially sovereign currency design; toward a universal multi-capital ledger (triple-entry plus ecological metrics).
- Pathway: a cosmo-local network of regenerative projects with partner-state support.

## Day 1 - Cadell Last - Key Points
- Constructivist view: institutions are built; the commons are useful as a seed form only if tied to property and production.
- Cautions: avoid deifying technology or using the word 'commons' as branding; the modern left has drifted from workers and class.
- Parallax: politics runs on conflicting frames (culture vs. economics; the right's 'unity' sustained by polarization).
- Global frame: the post-WWII consensus is ending; growth ideology is cracking; some form of global coordination is needed.
- Practical focus: own productive assets, deliver material gains, and build institutions that can carry plural narratives.

## Day 2 - Ronald Jean Toussaint - Key Points
- Musil reference: from the Man Without Qualities to a medium without qualities. Mass media replaces parents and teachers as transmitters.
- De Maistre reference: with the revolution, connection to tradition and nature was severed.
- Lack of transmission: intergenerational wisdom and craft do not pass on; people look outward for enemies instead of inward for formation.
- Degeneration of resonance: weaker bonds to people, places, and the non-human world.

## Day 2 - Workshop Takeaways: Hyperhumanism
- Definition: an umbrella for dimension-enhancing technologies, old and new (from craft and ritual to data, AI, and biotech).
- Economics: commit to positive, regenerative outcomes instead of extraction.
- Intentionality: embed purpose and norms into tools, places, and institutions.
- Commons: organize and showcase these technologies as shared resources with open access and shared governance.

---
## Synthesis - Core takeaway
- Build place-based, worker-owned regenerative projects that share open designs and a multi-capital ledger globally (cosmo-local).
- Frame this with Hyperhumanism: tools should enhance human depth and reciprocity with nature, not replace transmission and resonance.
- Use partner-state style support and translocal coordination, while keeping governance federated.
- Aim for concrete benefits first (lower bills, better wages, restored land) to bridge the digital-local divide.
